## HW1 Part Two: Programming

## Introduction:
The package consists of 2 files HW1_2abc.py and HW1_2d.py.<br> 
- HW1_2abc.py answers questions 2a, 2b and 2c. 
- HW1_2d.py answers question 2d.

## Requirements:

- Python 3.11.5gi
<br>

Python libraries required
<br>
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Instructions to run the code:
- Question 2a and 2b: 
  - Use the command 'python HW1_2abc.py' to run the file.
  - The output plot is the answer to 2a.
  - The answer to 2b is printer in system output as average discounted return and variance. 
- Question 2c:
  - Change the value of gamma variable to desired value {0.25,0.5 etc.}
  - Run using the same command mentioned above.
  - The system output printer will give the average discounted return corresponding to different gammas.
- Question 2d:
  - Use the command 'python HW1_2d.py' to run the file.
