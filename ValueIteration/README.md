## Value Iteration in Gridworld

## Introduction:
The package consists of 1 file Value_Iteration.py<br>
- Value_Iteration.py: It implements the Value Iteration algorithm to find the optimal value function and the optimal policy for 5x5 Gridworld.
## Requirements:
This code has been tested with
- Python 3.11.5
  <br>

Python libraries required
<br>
- numpy

## Instructions to run the code:
#### Running the Value Iteration algorithm on 5x5 Gridworld:
- Use the command 'python Value_Iteration.py' to run the file.
- The system output displays the Final Value function and the Final policy learned.
##### Changing Hyperparameters/Domain:
- Change the value of gamma to desired value(eg. 0.25) in Line 10 of the file.
- Rewards for different states are defined in Lines 7-10 of the file. Uncomment Line 10 to add the gold state. Add any additional reward states in a similar manner.
- Add symbol for terminal state in Line 101.
- Use the command 'python Value_Iteration.py' to run the file.
- The system output displays the Final Value function and the Final policy learned.
